============

This folder contains the Python script that reads the code model of
the Orthanc SDK that is generated by the "orthanc-java" project [1],
then automatically wraps this SDK as a Python extension module.

The output of the script is written to "../Sources/Autogenerated".

Usage:

$ ./GenerateOrthancSDK.py
